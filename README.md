# Web Components - Stock Market App

![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

Update 7-28-21! The app now fetches live stock quotes from [FinnHub.io](https://finnhub.io/docs/api) for each stock entered. You no longer have to manually enter the current price. Your stocks are also now saved. So you can navigate away from the site and the cards are there when you come back. When you delete a card, it is removed from your saved stocks.

I created this app to learn web components, practice with CSS flexbox, and practice my CSS styling. I had a lot of fun and learned a ton about Web Components! Deployed on [GitHub pages](https://sg0703.github.io/Web_Components/).
